# DATS6501-Capstone
Cheng Miao - Graduate Thesis - Capstone

## Idea
I propose to learn a new Deep Learning Framework and machine learning method that predicts the customer’s revenue based on data from the Google store.

## Code
Download file ChengMiao_Capstone_Project.ipynb. And also have to data.csv.zip file and extract the zip file to running code.

## Running code
Open mac terminal, and run the comment list below:

jupyter notebook ChengMiao_Capstone_Project.ipynb

That will open in Chrome or Safari to show Jupyter Notebook and file.

## Data
The data has 50 columns, with “transaction Revenue” as the target to explore the relationship between the rest of the dataset. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle, which has factors such as Visitor ID, Country, Year, Source, etc.

features: 12 featuers

Target variable: Transaction Revenue
